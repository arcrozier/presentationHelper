# presentationHelper
An Android app to help you give clear, effective presentations

To give it a try, clone the repo and open it with Android Studio. Launch on any Android device or emulator running Android 10 (Q) or higher.

All of the code is in the MainActivity.java file, should be pretty self-explanatory how it works.
